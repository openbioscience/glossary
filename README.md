# Glossary

## #
- **3' untranslated region (3'-UTR).** Plays a critical role in translation termination and post-_transcriptional_ modification. It is also involved in localizing the mRNA in the cell.
- **5' untranslated region (5'-UTR).**

## A
- **active immunotherapy.** A type of immunotherapy that stimulates the host's immune system or specific immune response to a disease or pathogen. It is most commonly used in cancer treatments.
- **antibody drug conjugate (ADC).**
- **aligned reads.**

## B

- **bispecific T cell engager (BiTE).**

## C
- **CD4+ T cells.**
- **CD8+ T cells.**
- **ChIP-seq.** Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays combined with sequencing. A powerful method for identifying genome-wide _DNA binding sites for transcription factors and other proteins_.
- **CIP priority rules (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog).**
- **coding sequence (CDS).**
- **correlation spectroscopy (COSY).**

## D

## E
- **enrichment (genetics, genomics).** A measure of how much more likely than chance a gene or other feature appears. See [this reddit post](https://archive.is/bBZ9V) for an example.

## F
- **feedstock.** The raw material that supplies or fuels a machine or industrial process.
- **fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET).**

## G
- **genome order.** An ordering of **aligned reads** such that reads are sorted based on their alignment coordinate (the first index where the read aligns to the reference). When viewing SAM/BAM files, this refers to sorting along the third and fourth columns: reference sequence name (often the chromosome number), and one-based leftmost mapping position.
- **glycan.** Synonym for **polysaccharide**. Often also used colloquially in scientific literature to refer to biologically active oligosaccharides.
- **glycosylation.** The chemical process of adding a glycan to another molecule (often a protein).

## H
- **hESC.** Human embryonic stem cells.

## I

## J

## K

- **Kozak consensus sequence.** (`5'-ACCAUGG-3'`)

## L
- **leader sequence.** Another name for the **5' untranslated region** of mRNA.

## M
- **motifs (protein structure).** Also known as **supersecondary structures**, motifs are groupings of secondary structural elementary that occur in many unrelated globular proteins.

## N
- **nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy (NOESY).**

## O

## P
- **passive immunotherapy.** A type of immunotherapy in which donated or laboratory-made immune system components (often antibodies) are directly used to fight an infection or disease. Passive immunotherapy does not stimulate the host's immune system.
- **poly-A tail.** Essential for keeping the mRNA from being degraded.
- **pulse-chase analysis.** A method for examining a cellular process occuring over time by successively exposing the cells to a labeled compound (the "pulse") and then to the same compound in an unlabeled form (the "chase"). A classic example of a pulse-chase experiment is the **Meselson-Stahl experiment** that demonstrated the semiconservative model of DNA replication.

## Q
- **quench-flow kinetics.**

## R
- **Ribosome binding site (RBS).**

## S
- **self-consistent field (SCF).**
- **Shine-Dalgarno sequence.** (`5'-AGGAGGU-3'`)
- **single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).** See also: **single nucleotide variant**.
- **single nucleotide variant (SNV).** See also: **single nucleotide polymorphism**.
- **small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).**
- **structural variation (SV).**

## T
- **trailer sequence.** Another name for the **3' untranslated region** of mRNA.

## U

## V

## W

## X
- **X-ray crystallography (XRC).**

## Y

## Z
